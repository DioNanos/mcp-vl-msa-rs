//! A5 — Memory Interleave bounded: stateless round-trip state + per-round knobs.
//!
//! This is the **foundation** layer (A5.1). It defines the data types that
//! cross the `msa_interleave_round` tool boundary and the validation/clamping
//! of the per-round knobs. The round logic (route → dedup → fetch bounded →
//! inject → stats/budget/stop-hints) lands in A5.2; the MCP tool wiring and
//! tier defaults in A5.3. See `~/.docs/projects/mcp-msa-rs/2026-06-01_A5_DESIGN_V1.md`.
//!
//! **Why stateless** (design D1, Codex reversing M3): the cursor in
//! [`crate::session`] lives in process RAM and dies on MCP subprocess
//! reconnect/retry/crash, which would replay Memory Interleave from round 1.
//! Instead the state is small and the client already holds it, so the client
//! round-trips it in every request. Reconnect/crash become irrelevant — there
//! is no server-side session to lose, hence no file-lock/GC/race to manage.
//!
//! **Privacy** (design §7 risk 6): only IDs and counters ever live in the
//! state. Raw injected text never does — it would bloat the payload and echo
//! user content back through the client on every round.
